Birch is no implementation of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), not even written in Rust. The implementation won't take a modular approach to building anything, not even a Filecoin node in any programming language, completely ignoring the [Filecoin Protocol Specification](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/), specifically the virtual machine, blockchain, and node system.
